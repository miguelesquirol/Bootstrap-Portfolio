## Getting Started

I've been designing pages from more than 20 years, I started with basic html in old Netscape browser in a clunky machine, learned CSSl, moved from flash to HTML5, from tables and iframes to responsive sites, jQuery and CSS3 animations. I created many Wordpress sites, using templates, frameworks and even some of them from scratch. I had to learn CSS3, jQuery and PHP to keep up to date.

Since 2009 I started to work as webdesigner professionally, with small projects in an independent manner, designing, coding and hosting. Since 2013 I've been working full time as front end developer. Today I create useful pages for people, developing full fledged websites, and working in a company with thousands of clients.

Web design is still growing, and I plan to keep on learning.
